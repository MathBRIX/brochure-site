question = "What is MathBRIX?"
answer = """
  MathBRIX is a cloud-delivered supplementary math product that develops
  mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Children manipulate
  virtual toy bricks with a mouse or a finger swish across the tablet screen.
  Each brick’s clearly marked studs represent its numerical value, making
  them an ideal learning vehicle for teaching the four operations, square
  numbers, fractions, the commutative property of multiplication and
  proportional reasoning - as well as other concepts thought by many to be
  beyond young children’s comprehension.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "For which age range is MathBRIX intended?"
answer = """
  MathBRIX is currently available for K-2, however, both younger and older
  children enjoy playing the MathBRIX games. Age appropriate activities are
  in development for preschool children as well as standards-aligned games
  for grade 3.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "What does MathBRIX teach?"
answer = """
  MathBRIX is designed to enhance in-school curricula, not replace it. It
  targets the areas of low performance on the National Assessment of
  Mathematics and places emphasis on understanding the mathematical process,
  which is often overlooked during the busy school day. Each level is also
  aligned with the Common Core and the National Council of Teachers of
  Mathematics standards and can be synced to weekly in-school instruction.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Why is early math learning important?"
answer = """
  Early mathematics achievement is highly predictive of later school success,
  yet children’s math achievement varies widely at kindergarten entry.
  MathBRIX's innovative intervention strategies are designed to dramatically
  increase concept recognition and problem-solving in the crucial early
  years. In so doing, far less students will stay behind through elementary
  school or require extensive remediation. The methodology is based on
  established and emerging research – both in mathematics and educational
  technology.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "How is MathBRIX to be used in a classroom?"
answer = """
  MathBRIX games are meant to be used for 15 minutes per day, at least 2 days
  per week. Students can access the games at school and at home. Many
  activities require use of compatible bricks (Lego, MegaBloks) from one's
  own collection. Playing with physical bricks also contributes to children’s
  spatial reasoning, numerical knowledge, and problem-solving skills. The
  teachers' guide and parent handouts also explain how to encourage math talk
  and mathematical thinking during play as well as building on many math
  ideas contained in children’s books.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "How do MathBRIX's adaptive learning mechanics work?"
answer = """
  The adaptive learning mechanics provide games appropriate to the skills of
  the user, rather than by grade level. Although games are benchmarked by
  standards, several students in a given class may be performing above or
  below grade level, if appropriate. When students return to game play, the
  system allows them to continue exactly where they left off.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Are students actually signing onto the Internet?"
answer = """
  No. Teachers register students via MathBRIX's management system and print
  an individual QR code for each student. Students sign in for game play by
  passing the QR code across their device's camera. A class code is also
  generated and can be used with devices without cameras. Each individual
  device automatically syncs with the teacher's class list as students begin
  another round of game play. Data on usage and performance is tracked and
  sent to the teacher dashboard.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "What is the Teacher Dashboard?"
answer = """
  The Teacher Dashboard is an online classroom management tool that enables
  each teacher to register students and track their progress. Auto-generated
  reports include performance, usage, time on task, and standards addressed.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Are there any other activities to support MathBRIX?"
answer = """
  A number of off-computer activities and suggestions for math centers or
  home are in development. They will soon be available to all subscribers.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Can special needs students play the MathBRIX games?"
answer = """
  The games are primarily visual and require little reading - thus allowing
  children of all abilities to play and learn. In addition to the adaptive
  learning component, the product follows the Universal Design for Learning
  principles such as multiple means of representation and dynamic skill
  levels, child-friendly level progression and no negative feedback.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Why is MathBRIX subscription only?"
answer = """
  Our goal as a company is to provide high-quality and continually-improving
  education content that keeps kids learning month-after-month. The best way
  for us to offer this is via subscription. Doing so also allows us to avoid
  using online ads.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Are any discounts available?"
answer = """
  In addition to the discount offered to testing sites, financial incentives
  will be made to teachers who recruit other classroom participants too!
  School and district subscriptions are be available at reduced rates.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Does MathBRIX collect any private data?"
answer = """
  No. MathBRIX is COPPA-compliant and does not collect any private data on
  students.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Is MathBRIX available for the home?"
answer = """
  A consumer version will be available in 2019.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Can all platforms access MathBRIX?"
answer = """
  Currently students can play games on iPads, Chromebooks and the web.
"""

[[entries]]
question = "Can students play on traditional computers?"
answer = """
  Yes. MathBRIX is available on any computing device that contains the
  Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge browsers.
"""

question = "Can more than one teacher at the same school participate?"
answer = """
  Absolutely! One or all K-2 teachers in a given school may enroll.
