  <p class="f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
    and online services to post a privacy policy. The law applies beyond
    California, requiring any person or company in the United States (and
    conceivably in the world) that operates websites collecting Personally
    Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
    privacy policy on its website stating exactly what information is being
    collected and with which individuals or companies it is being shared. For
    more information about CalOPPA, use the following link:

  <h3 class="mt4 f5 f4-ns">Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h3>
  <p class="f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">
    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under
    the age of thirteen years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
    (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the consumer
    protection agency of the United States, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
    stipulates what operators of websites and online services must do to
    protect children's privacy and safety online.
  </p>
  <p class="f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">
    We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone
    under the age of thirteen without prior verifiable parental consent. If we
    become aware that a site visitor under the age of thirteen has provided
    personal data without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or
    her personally identifiable information from our files. In order to remove your
    child's information please contact the following personnel:
  </p>
  <p class="f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">
    We adhere to the following COPPA tenant:
  </p>
  <ul class="pl3 pl4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">

  <h3 class="mt4 f5 f4-ns">Fair Information Practices</h3>
  <p class="f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">
    The principles of the Fair Information Practices form the backbone of
    privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played
    a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
    globe. Understanding and implementing the principles of the Fair
    Information Practice is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
    that protect personal information.
  </p>
  <p class="f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">
    In accordance with Fair Information Practices, we will take responsive
    action should a data breach occur. We will notify you via email within
    seven business days of a breach. We will notify the users via in-site
    notification within seven business days of a breach.
  </p>
  <p class="f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy">
    Also in line with Fair Information Practices, we adhere to the Individual
    Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have the right to
    legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors
    who fail to adhere to the law. This principle states not only that
    individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
    individuals have recourse to courts and/or government agencies to
    investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

  <h3 class="mt4 f5 f4-ns">CAN-SPAM Act</h3>
