  <h3 class="f3">What is MathBRIX?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    MathBRIX is a cloud-delivered supplementary math product that develops
    mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Children manipulate
    virtual toy bricks with a mouse or a finger swish across the tablet screen.
    Each brick’s clearly marked studs represent its numerical value, making
    them an ideal learning vehicle for teaching the four operations, square
    numbers, fractions, the commutative property of multiplication and
    proportional reasoning - as well as other concepts thought by many to be
    beyond young children’s comprehension.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">For which age range is MathBRIX intended?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    MathBRIX is currently available for K-2, however, both younger and older
    children enjoy playing the MathBRIX games. Age appropriate activities are
    in development for preschool children as well as standards-aligned games
    for grade 3.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">What does MathBRIX teach?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    MathBRIX is designed to enhance in-school curricula, not replace it. It
    targets the areas of low performance on the National Assessment of
    Mathematics and places emphasis on understanding the mathematical process,
    which is often overlooked during the busy school day. Each level is also
    aligned with the Common Core and the National Council of Teachers of
    Mathematics standards and can be synced to weekly in-school instruction.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Why is early math learning important?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    Early mathematics achievement is highly predictive of later school success,
    yet children’s math achievement varies widely at kindergarten entry.
    MathBRIX's innovative intervention strategies are designed to dramatically
    increase concept recognition and problem-solving in the crucial early
    years. In so doing, far less students will stay behind through elementary
    school or require extensive remediation. The methodology is based on
    established and emerging research – both in mathematics and educational
    technology.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">How is MathBRIX to be used in a classroom?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    MathBRIX games are meant to be used for 15 minutes per day, at least 2 days
    per week. Students can access the games at school and at home. Many
    activities require use of compatible bricks (Lego, MegaBloks) from one's
    own collection. Playing with physical bricks also contributes to children’s
    spatial reasoning, numerical knowledge, and problem-solving skills. The
    teachers' guide and parent handouts also explain how to encourage math talk
    and mathematical thinking during play as well as building on many math
    ideas contained in children’s books.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">How do MathBRIX's adaptive learning mechanics work?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    The adaptive learning mechanics provide games appropriate to the skills of
    the user, rather than by grade level. Although games are benchmarked by
    standards, several students in a given class may be performing above or
    below grade level, if appropriate. When students return to game play, the
    system allows them to continue exactly where they left off.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Are students actually signing onto the Internet?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    No. Teachers register students via MathBRIX's management system and print
    an individual QR code for each student. Students sign in for game play by
    passing the QR code across their device's camera. A class code is also
    generated and can be used with devices without cameras. Each individual
    device automatically syncs with the teacher's class list as students begin
    another round of game play. Data on usage and performance is tracked and
    sent to the teacher dashboard.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">What is the Teacher Dashboard?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    The Teacher Dashboard is an online classroom management tool that enables
    each teacher to register students and track their progress. Auto-generated
    reports include performance, usage, time on task, and standards addressed.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Are there any other activities to support MathBRIX?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    A number of off-computer activities and suggestions for math centers or
    home are in development. They will soon be available to all subscribers.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Can special needs students play the MathBRIX games?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    The games are primarily visual and require little reading - thus allowing
    children of all abilities to play and learn. In addition to the adaptive
    learning component, the product follows the Universal Design for Learning
    principles such as multiple means of representation and dynamic skill
    levels, child-friendly level progression and no negative feedback.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Why is MathBRIX subscription only?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    Our goal as a company is to provide high-quality and continually-improving
    education content that keeps kids learning month-after-month. The best way
    for us to offer this is via subscription. Doing so also allows us to avoid
    using online ads.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Are any discounts available?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    In addition to the discount offered to testing sites, financial incentives
    will be made to teachers who recruit other classroom participants too!
    School and district subscriptions are be available at reduced rates.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Does MathBRIX collect any private data?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    No. MathBRIX is COPPA-compliant and does not collect any private data on students.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Is MathBRIX available for the home?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    A consumer version will be available in 2019.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Can all platforms access MathBRIX?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    Currently students can play games on iPads, Chromebooks and the web.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Can students play on traditional computers?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    Yes. MathBRIX is available on any computing device that contains the
    Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge browsers.
  </p>

  <h3 class="f3">Can more than one teacher at the same school participate?</h3>
  <p class="f4 fw3 lh-copy">
    Absolutely! One or all K-2 teachers in a given school may enroll.
