      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        MathBRIX is a tool that's easy to weave into existing class routines.
        It is ideal for use in classroom station rotation models, in the
        library as well as in afterschool clubs. QR codes make it a breeze for
        students to log themselves in. The system jumps them straight into the
        action – no need to mess with a lot of menus.

      <h3 class="f3 normal">A Methodology That Works</h3>
      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        MathBRIX's visual langauges and use of manipulatives are derived from
        the federally-funded Comprehensive School Mathematics Program (CSMP),
        a constructivist model of "learning by doing” that has been proven to
        increase young children's mathematical thinking and problem-solving
        skills.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        MathBRIX is an ideal companion to any in-school math program. It
        broadens traditional programs with problem-solving and concept
        acquisition activities. It also provides extended practice for newer
        curricula such as Singapore Math, Engage NY, Math in Focus, and Eureka
        Math, all of which follow the same steps to understanding.

      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        The MathBRIX teacher dashboard allows you to follow along with the
        progress of your class. Analytics show student performance and time
        spent on each activity, as well as standards addressed and mastered.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        A color-coded class matrix also helps you see patterns in data,
        identifying groups of students who are having trouble with the same
        concept, and allowing you to better target your small group instruction.

      <h3 class="f3 normal">Cloud Portable</h3>
      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        MathBRIX games can be played on any device, including stand-alones,
        laptops, and Chromebooks via the web. Downloadable applications are
        available for iPads too. Since MathBRIX is cloud-portable, students
        don’t need to start over when switching devices, but are able to pick-up
        exactly where they left off.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        Students use their own unique password to access their games at home.
        Families can even join in the fun! Performance and usage data are
        automatically sent to the teacher's dashboard whenever a new connection
        is made. Teachers may also share individual reports with the student's
        parents.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f3 normal">Offline Mode</h3>
      <p class="f4 lh-copy fw3 gray">
        The system is designed to work in an offline mode. Once the games are
        downloaded, students can keep playing even without an Internet
        connection. Once a new connection is made, student data on performance
        and usage is uploaded to the Teacher Dashboard.
