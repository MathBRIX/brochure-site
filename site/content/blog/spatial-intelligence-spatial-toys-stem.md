This fascinating interview with Psychologist Nora Newcombe delves into the relationship between spatial intelligence and success in STEM fields (math in particular), and also into the factors that lead to development of strong spatial reasoning skills.

- Spatial intelligence is not hard-wired, it is developed through practice
- Children who play frequently with puzzles, blocks and other spatial toys tend to have better spatial reasoning ability
