description = "The ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide are the cornerstone of elementary mathematics. In MathBRIX, kids practice operations using virtual manipulatives (Brix) to solve problems. This approach to solving operations is helpful for a number of reasons: 1) it provides children with visual context for the problems they are solving and 2) it gives them insight into why different algebraic strategies (composing numbers, decomposing numbers, making 10, etc.) actually work."
